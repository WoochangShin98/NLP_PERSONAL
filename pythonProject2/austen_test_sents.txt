_must_ feel in promoting her children’s enjoyment was attributed to her nature.
Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “Yes”; and at the end of a quarter of an hour’s silent consideration spontaneously observed, “Sir Thomas, I have been thinking—and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.”  Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, “Very true.
We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face, she is now a very valuable companion.
If we have been kind to _her_, she is now quite as necessary to _us_.”  “Yes,” said Lady Bertram presently; “and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _her_.”  Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely replied, “She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here.”  “And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas.
Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her.”  The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in Mansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage.
To the young lady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings.
What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to Mary.
Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one so easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more might be imputed to difference of circumstances.
In some points of interest they were exactly opposed to each other.
To Fanny’s mind, Edmund’s absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief.
To Mary it was every way painful.
She felt the want of his society every day, almost every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went.
He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week’s absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her brother’s going away, of William Price’s going too, and completing the sort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated.
They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors by a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.
Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of him continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had.
His absence was unnecessarily long.
He should not have planned such an absence—he should not have left home for a week, when her own departure from Mansfield was so near.
Then she began to blame herself.
She wished she had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation.
She was afraid she had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the clergy, and that should not have been.
It was ill-bred; it was wrong.
She wished such words unsaid with all her heart.
Her vexation did not end with the week.
All this was bad, but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund; when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised to remain some days longer with his friend.
If she had felt impatience and regret before—if she had been sorry for what she said, and feared its too strong effect on him—she now felt and feared it all tenfold more.
She had, moreover, to contend with one disagreeable emotion entirely new to her—jealousy.
His friend Mr. Owen had sisters; he might find them attractive.
But, at any rate, his staying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was to remove to London, meant something that she could not bear.
Had Henry returned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she should now have been leaving Mansfield.
It became absolutely necessary for her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more.
She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her way to the Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in addition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.
The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together, and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing.
But at last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And how do _you_ like your cousin Edmund’s staying away so long?
Being the only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.
Does his staying longer surprise you?”  “I do not know,” said Fanny hesitatingly.
“Yes; I had not particularly expected it.”  “Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of.
It is the general way all young men do.”  “He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.”  “He finds the house more agreeable _now_.
He is a very—a very pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the case.
I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield.
I should like to have seen him once more, I confess.
But you must give my compliments to him.
Yes; I think it must be compliments.
Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price, in our language—a something between compliments and—and love—to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together?
So many months’ acquaintance!
But compliments may be sufficient here.
Was his letter a long one?
Does he give you much account of what he is doing?
Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?”  “I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines.
All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed to do so.
A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I am not quite sure which.”  “Oh!
if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you.
But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise.
Who could write chat to Sir Thomas?
If he had written to you, there would have been more particulars.
You would have heard of balls and parties.
He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody.
How many Miss Owens are there?”  “Three grown up.”  “Are they musical?”  “I do not at all know.
I never heard.”  “That is the first question, you know,” said Miss Crawford, trying to appear gay and unconcerned, “which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another.
But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies—about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty.
There is a beauty in every family; it is a regular thing.
Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for not being taught; or something like it.”  “I know nothing of the Miss Owens,” said Fanny calmly.
“You know nothing and you care less, as people say.
Never did tone express indifference plainer.
Indeed, how can one care for those one has never seen?
Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself.
I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near.
She does not like my going.”  Fanny felt obliged to speak.
“You cannot doubt your being missed by many,” said she.
“You will be very much missed.”  Miss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear or see more, and then laughingly said, “Oh yes!
missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt.
But I am not fishing; don’t compliment me.
If I _am_ missed, it will appear.
I may be discovered by those who want to see me.
I shall not be in any doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.”  Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was disappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded again.
“The Miss Owens,” said she, soon afterwards; “suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it?
I dare say they are trying for it.
And they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishment for them.
I do not at all wonder or blame them.
It is everybody’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can.
Sir Thomas Bertram’s son is somebody; and now he is in their own line.
Their father is a clergyman, and their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.
He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them.
You don’t speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don’t speak.
But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?”  “No,” said Fanny stoutly, “I do not expect it at all.”  “Not at all!” cried Miss Crawford with alacrity.
“I wonder at that.
But I dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all—or not at present.”  “No, I do not,” said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it.
Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look, only said, “He is best off as he is,” and turned the subject.
CHAPTER XXX   Miss Crawford’s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to try her own.
His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke—suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself.
And the next day _did_ bring a surprise to her.
Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but he was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, “My dear Henry, where can you have been all this time?” he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny.
“Sitting with them an hour and a half!” exclaimed Mary.
But this was only the beginning of her surprise.
“Yes, Mary,” said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was: “I could not get away sooner; Fanny looked so lovely!
I am quite determined, Mary.
My mind is entirely made up.
No: you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price.”  The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister’s imagination; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully and more solemnly.
The conviction of his determination once admitted, it was not unwelcome.
There was even pleasure with the surprise.
Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother’s marrying a little beneath him.
“Yes, Mary,” was Henry’s concluding assurance.
“I am fairly caught.
You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them.
I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed.”  “Lucky, lucky girl!” cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; “what a match for her!
My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it.
You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion.
What an amazing match for her!
Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now?
The delight of all the family, indeed!
And she has some _true_ friends in it!
But tell me all about it!
Talk to me for ever.
When did you begin to think seriously about her?”  Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked.
“How the pleasing plague had stolen on him” he could not say; and before he had expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over, his sister eagerly interrupted him with, “Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what took you to London!
You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind.”  But this he stoutly denied.
He knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme.
The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.
“When Fanny is known to him,” continued Henry, “he will doat on her.
She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral, for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world.
She is the very impossibility he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas.
But till it is absolutely settled—settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter.
No, Mary, you are quite mistaken.
You have not discovered my business yet.”  “Well, well, I am satisfied.
I know now to whom it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest.
That Mansfield should have done so much for—that _you_ should have found your fate in Mansfield!
But you are quite right; you could not have chosen better.
There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not want for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good.
The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country.
She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world.
But go on, go on.
Does she know her own happiness?”  “No.”  “What are you waiting for?”  “For—for very little more than opportunity.
Mary, she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.”  “Oh no!
Were you even less pleasing—supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)—you would be safe.
The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately.
From my soul I do not think she would marry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.”  As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny’s charms.
Fanny’s beauty of face and figure, Fanny’s graces of manner and goodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme.
The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman’s worth in the judgment of man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never believe it absent.
Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise.
He had often seen it tried.
Was there one of the family, excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance?
Her affections were evidently strong.
To see her with her brother!
What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness?
What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view?
Then, her understanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind.
Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity, he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious.
“I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,” said he; “and _that_ is what I want.”  Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.
“The more I think of it,” she cried, “the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy.
Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed.
You will both find your good in it.”  “It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head.
I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else.
I will not take her from Northamptonshire.
I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge.
I shall let a seven years’ lease of Everingham.
I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word.
I could name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.”  “Ha!” cried Mary; “settle in Northamptonshire!
Then we shall be all together.”  When she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in her.
“You must give us more than half your time,” said he.
“I cannot admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you.
Fanny will be so truly your sister!”  Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister many months longer.
“You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?”  “Yes.”  “That’s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer with the Admiral.
My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life!
_You_ are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you.
To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would have broken my heart.”  “Well, well, we do not think quite alike here.
The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me.
Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much.
You must not prejudice Fanny against him.
I must have them love one another.”  Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant: time would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflection on the Admiral.
“Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_ would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman.”  The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer.
“Had you seen her this morning, Mary,” he continued, “attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt’s stupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman’s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to _me_, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said.
Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing.”  “My dearest Henry,” cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face, “how glad I am to see you so much in love!
But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?”  “I care neither what they say nor what they feel.
They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense.
I wish the discovery may do them any good.
And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness.
They will be angry,” he added, after a moment’s silence, and in a cooler tone; “Mrs.
Rushworth will be very angry.
It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments’ ill flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women’s, though _I_ was the object of them.
Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due.
Now she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.”  “Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or forgotten.
Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.”  “Edmund!
True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior, long-worded, arbitrary uncle.
What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what _do_ they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in the world, to what I _shall_ do?”     CHAPTER XXXI   Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants.
The two ladies were together in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered.
She was almost at the door, and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for, and a “Let Sir Thomas know” to the servant.
Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some letters, said, with a most animated look, “I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea.
Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring.
Your brother is a lieutenant.
I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother’s promotion.
Here are the letters which announce it, this moment come to hand.
You will, perhaps, like to see them.”  Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak.
To see the expression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress of her feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough.
She took the letters as he gave them.
The first was from the Admiral to inform his nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral had set to work in the business, the other from that friend to himself, by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price’s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.
While her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from one to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event—  “I will not talk of my own happiness,” said he, “great as it is, for I think only of yours.
Compared with you, who has a right to be happy?
I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world.
I have not lost a moment, however.
The post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment’s delay.
How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London!
I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield.
But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these.
My uncle, who is the very best man in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your brother.
He was delighted with him.
I would not allow myself yesterday Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days after the Croft’s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or her friend’s carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.
He was standing by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice.
When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour.
Thank you, thank you.
This is treating me like a friend.
Here I am, you see, staring at a picture.
I can never get by this shop without stopping.
But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!
Did you ever see the like?
What queer fellows your fine painters must be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that?
And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be.
I wonder where that boat was built!” (laughing heartily); “I would not venture over a horsepond in it.
Well,” (turning away), “now, where are you bound?
Can I go anywhere for you, or with you?
Can I be of any use?”  “None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together.
I am going home.”  “That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.
Yes, yes we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go along.
There, take my arm; that’s right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.
what a boat it is!” taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.
“Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?”  “Yes, I have, presently.
But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, ‘How d’ye do?’ as we pass, however.
‘How d’ye do?’ Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.
She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.
She has a blister on one of her heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.
If you look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.
Shabby fellows, both of them!
I am glad they are not on this side of the way.
Sophy cannot bear them.
They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men.
I will tell you the whole story another time.
There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.
Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.
the peace has come too soon for that younker.
How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?
It suits us very well.
We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.
We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.
The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.”  When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate.
She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.
As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began—  “Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.
But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about.
That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned for.
The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.
Her Christian name: I always forget her Christian name.”  Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did; but now she could safely suggest the name of “Louisa.”  “Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.
I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names.
I should never be out if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.
Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.
He was courting her week after week.
The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.
But even then there was something odd in their way of going on.
Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward.
When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward’s, and there he has been ever since.
We have seen nothing of him since November.
Even Sophy could not understand it.
But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.
You know James Benwick.”  “A little.
I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.”  “Well, she is to marry him.
Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.”  “I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,” said Anne, “and I understand that he bears an excellent character.”  “Oh!
yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.
He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.
An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.”  “Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick’s manners.
I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.”  “Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick’s manners better than his.
There is something about Frederick more to our taste.”  Anne was caught.
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to represent Captain Benwick’s manners as the very best that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say, “I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,” but the Admiral interrupted her with—  “And the thing is certainly true.
It is not a mere bit of gossip.
We have it from Frederick himself.
His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.
I fancy they are all at Uppercross.”  This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore, “I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth’s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.
It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally, and without violence.
I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.”  “Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end.”  Anne looked down to hide her smile.
“No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that.
If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him.”  “Certainly.
But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth’s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely said.
I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.”  “Yes, yes, I understand you.
But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter.
He does not give the least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, ‘I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.’ No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what’s her name?)
He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think.”  Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.
She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.
“Poor Frederick!” said he at last.
“Now he must begin all over again with somebody else.
I think we must get him to Bath.
Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath.
Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.
It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.
Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?”     CHAPTER XIX.
While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither.
Before Mrs Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.
Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.
They were in Milsom Street.
It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple’s carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland’s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.
He soon joined them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.
Her ladyship’s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four with any comfort.
Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies.
There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.
Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two.
The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.
But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick!
much thicker than Miss Anne’s; and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne’s boots were rather the thickest.
It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain Wentworth walking down the street.
Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and absurd!
For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all confusion.
She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay’s.
She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to see if it rained.
Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.
She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.
She would see if it rained.
She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street.
He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite red.
For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.
She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.
All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise were over with her.
Still, however, she had enough to feel!
It was agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.
He spoke to her, and then turned away.
The character of his manner was embarrassment.
She could not have called it either cold or friendly, or anything so certainly as embarrassed.
After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed: neither of them, probably, much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly.
They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.
Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.
There was consciousness of some sort or other.
He looked very well, not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross, of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.
It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him.
She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance, expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness.
Lady Dalrymple’s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.
It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.
At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.
“I am much obliged to you,” was her answer, “but I am not going with them.
The carriage would not accommodate so many.
I walk: I prefer walking.”  “But it rains.”  “Oh!
Nothing that I regard.”  After a moment’s pause he said: “Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,” (pointing to a new umbrella); “I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair.”  She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding, “I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.
He will be here in a moment, I am sure.”  She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.
Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.
There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend.
He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a “Good morning to you!” being all that she had time for, as she passed away.
As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth’s party began talking of them.
“Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?”  “Oh!
no, that is clear enough.
One can guess what will happen there.
He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.
What a very good-looking man!”  “Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.”  “She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to look at her.
It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire her more than her sister.”  “Oh!
so do I.”  “And so do I.
But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.
Anne is too delicate for them.”  Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.
She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.
But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth.
She could not understand his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled, she could not be quite herself.
She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas!
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.
Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not recollect it.
He might be only passing through.
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay.
In that case, so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere.
How would it all be?
She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick.
It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell’s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.
The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street.
There were many other men about him, many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.
She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.
No, it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite.
She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell’s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him—of her being, in short, intently observing him.
She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell’s mind, the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!
At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.
“Now, how would she speak of him?”  “You will wonder,” said she, “what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.
They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.”  Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself.
The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.
A day or two passed without producing anything.
The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.
It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.
Of course they must attend.
It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.
If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred.
Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.
She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.
Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.
“By all means,” said she; “only tell me all about it, when you do come.
Who is your party?”  Anne named them all.
Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, “Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you.”  Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment’s suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.
Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room.
But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.
Anne was the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.
He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle “How do you do?” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.
Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done.
While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear.
She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth’s making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.
This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than nothing, and her spirits improved.
After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert, their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little smile, a little glow, he said—  “I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.
I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you at the time.”  She assured him that she had not.
“It was a frightful hour,” said he, “a frightful day!” and he passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added, “The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.
When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.”  “Certainly I could have none.
But it appears—I should hope it would be a very happy match.
There are on both sides good principles and good temper.”  “Yes,” said he, looking not exactly forward; “but there, I think, ends the resemblance.
With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it.
They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.
The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter’s comfort.
All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps—”  He stopped.
A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne’s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground.
After clearing his throat, however, he proceeded thus—  “I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than mind.
I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more.
He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise.
Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing.
But I have no reason to suppose it so.
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.
A man like him, in his situation!
with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!
