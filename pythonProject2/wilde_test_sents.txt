back to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing.
And ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was within him.
And when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the little Mermaid.
But she came not to his call, though he called to her all day long and besought her.
And his Soul mocked him and said, ‘Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.
Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken vessel.
Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in return.
It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.’  But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock he built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a year.
And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.
Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep.
And ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible things.
Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of his love.
And after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, ‘I have tempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.
I will tempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.’  So he spake to the young Fisherman and said, ‘I have told thee of the joy of the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.
Suffer me now to tell thee of the world’s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.
For of a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who escapes from its net.
There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread.
There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in rags.
To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each other.
The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are empty.
Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates.
Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and make them not to be.
Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy love, seeing she comes not to thy call?
And what is love, that thou shouldst set this high store upon it?’  But the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his love.
And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.
Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.
And after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman at night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, ‘Lo!
now I have tempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love is stronger than I am.
Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.’  ‘Surely thou mayest enter,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘for in the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered.’  ‘Alas!’ cried his Soul, ‘I can find no place of entrance, so compassed about with love is this heart of thine.’  ‘Yet I would that I could help thee,’ said the young Fisherman.
And as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the cry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.
And the young Fisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the shore.
And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter than silver.
White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed on the waves.
And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.
Dead at his feet it was lying.
Weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the hair.
He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one trembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.
Cold were the lips, yet he kissed them.
Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a bitter joy.
He kissed the closed eyelids, and the wild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.
And to the dead thing he made confession.
Into the shells of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale.
He put the little hands round his neck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat.
Bitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.
The black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.
With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.
From the palace of the Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.
‘Flee away,’ said his Soul, ‘for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if thou tarriest it will slay thee.
Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.
Flee away to a place of safety.
Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?’  But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, ‘Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.
The fires cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.
I called on thee at dawn, and thou didst not come to my call.
The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed of me.
For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.
Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was it strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon evil and looked upon good.
And now that thou art dead, surely I will die with thee also.’  And his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his love.
And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves, and when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.
And as through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.
And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.
* * * * *  And in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had been troubled.
And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.
And when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little Mermaid.
And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the cross, he cried aloud and said, ‘I will not bless the sea nor anything that is in it.
Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them.
And as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body and the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none may know the place of their resting.
For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.’  And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead things within it.
And when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the Priest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds of the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.
And when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers that never had been seen before.
Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.
And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.
And after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance that was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again behind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to speak to them of the wrath of God.
But the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is Love.
And why he so spake, he knew not.
And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.
And the deacons came in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple and the stole.
And he stood as one in a dream.
And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, ‘What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?’  And they answered him, ‘What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they come from the corner of the Fullers’ Field.’  And the Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed.
And in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers, and a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the wild things that are in it.
The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed things that peer through the leaves.
All the things in God’s world he blessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.
Yet never again in the corner of the Fullers’ Field grew flowers of any kind, but the field remained barren even as before.
Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.
THE STAR-CHILD                                       TO                            MISS MARGOT TENNANT                               [MRS. ASQUITH]  ONCE upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine-forest.
It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.
The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.
So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.
‘Ugh!’ snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, ‘this is perfectly monstrous weather.
Why doesn’t the Government look to it?’  ‘Weet!
weet!’ twittered the green Linnets, ‘the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.’  ‘The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,’ whispered the Turtle-doves to each other.
Their little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.
‘Nonsense!’ growled the Wolf.
‘I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.’  The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.
‘Well, for my own part,’ said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, ‘I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.
If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.’  Terribly cold it certainly was.
The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.
The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.
Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, ‘Tu-whit!
what delightful weather we are having!’  On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.
Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.
But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.
So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.
Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‘Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?
Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.’  ‘Truly,’ answered his companion, ‘much is given to some, and little is given to others.
Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.’  But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.
There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.
It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s-throw away.
there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,’ they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.
And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo!
there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.
So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.
And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.
no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.
And one of them said to the other: ‘This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?
Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.’  But his companion answered him: ‘Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.’  So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.
And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, ‘Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.’  But he answered him: ‘Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,’ and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.
And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.
But he said to her, ‘I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,’ and he stirred not from the threshold.
‘What is it?’ she cried.
‘Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.’  And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.
‘Alack, goodman!’ she murmured, ‘have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?
And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?
And how shall we tend it?’  And she was wroth against him.
‘Nay, but it is a Star-Child,’ he answered; and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.
But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: ‘Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?
Who is there who careth for us?
And who giveth us food?’  ‘Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,’ he answered.
‘Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?’ she asked.
‘And is it not winter now?’  And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.
And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‘Wilt thou not close the door?
There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.’  ‘Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?’ he asked.
And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.
And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.
And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.
And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.
* * * * *  So the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.
And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.
His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.
Yet did his beauty work him evil.
For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.
The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.
No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.
Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.
Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‘We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.
Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?’  Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: ‘The fly is thy brother.
The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.
Snare them not for thy pleasure.
God made the blind-worm and the mole, and each has its place.
Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?
Even the cattle of the field praise Him.’  But the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.
And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.
And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.
And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.
And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.
* * * * *  Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.
Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.
And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.
But when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, ‘See!
There sitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.
Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.’  So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.
And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: ‘Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?’  And the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, ‘Who art thou to question me what I do?
I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.’  ‘Thou speakest truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.’  And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.
And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.
But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, ‘Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?
And was it not ten years from this day?’  And the Woodcutter answered, ‘Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.’  ‘And what signs didst thou find with him?’ she cried.
‘Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?
Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?’  ‘Truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘it was even as thou sayest.’  And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.
And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‘He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.
I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.’  So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and said to him, ‘Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.’  So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.
But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, ‘Why, where is my mother?
For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.’  And the woman answered him, ‘I am thy mother.’  ‘Thou art mad to say so,’ cried the Star-Child angrily.
‘I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.
Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.’  ‘Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,’ she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.
‘The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,’ she murmured, ‘but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.
Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.
Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.’  But the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.
And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.
‘If in very truth thou art my mother,’ he said, ‘it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.
Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.’  ‘Alas!
my son,’ she cried, ‘wilt thou not kiss me before I go?
For I have suffered much to find thee.’  ‘Nay,’ said the Star-Child, ‘but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.’  So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.
But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.
Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,’ and they drave him out of the stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold.
On and on he glided, like an evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.
Once he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air.
Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless Washington's room.
For a moment he paused there, the wind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud.
Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come.
He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched face in his long, bony hands.
Right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's dream!
Its head was bald and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin.
From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.
On its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of shame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime, and, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.
[Illustration: "ITS HEAD WAS BALD AND BURNISHED"]  Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened, and, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to his room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the corridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.
Once in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small pallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes.
After a time, however, the brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.
Accordingly, just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins.
On reaching the spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze.
Something had evidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude.
He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!
Unable to understand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--          +------------------------------------+         |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |         | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |         |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.
|         |   All others are counterfeite.
|         +------------------------------------+  The whole thing flashed across him.
He had been tricked, foiled, and out-witted!
The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his head, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.
Hardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a distant homestead, a cock crew.
He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh, and waited.
Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange reason, did not crow again.
Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of the housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back to his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose.
There he consulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath had been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time.
"Perdition seize the naughty fowl," he muttered, "I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!"
He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and stayed there till evening.
IV   [Illustration: "HE MET WITH A SEVERE FALL"]  The next day the ghost was very weak and tired.
The terrible excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect.
His nerves were completely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise.
For five days he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the blood-stain on the library floor.
If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve it.
They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena.
The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under his control.
It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations.
It is quite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.
For the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen.
He removed his boots, trod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains.
I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection.
However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle.
He felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it served his purpose.
Still in spite of everything he was not left unmolested.
Strings were continually being stretched across the corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while dressed for the part of "Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods," he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the top of the oak staircase.
This last insult so enraged him, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next night in his celebrated character of "Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl."
[Illustration: "A HEAVY JUG OF WATER FELL RIGHT DOWN ON HIM."]
He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight.
Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by Lord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken heart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it had been a great success.
It was, however an extremely difficult "make-up," if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more scientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations.
At last everything was ready, and he was very pleased with his appearance.
The big leather riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only find one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite satisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor.
On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar.
Wishing to make an effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches.
At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed.
The shock to his nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold.
The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences might have been very serious.
[Illustration: "MAKING SATIRICAL REMARKS ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS"]  He now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family, and contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in list slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the twins.
The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September.
He had gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of the Canterville family pictures.
He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade.
In fact, he was dressed for the character of "Jonas the Graveless, or the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn," one of his most remarkable impersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to remember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord Rufford.
It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring.
As he was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any traces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a dark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads, and shrieked out "BOO!"
[Illustration: "SUDDENLY THERE LEAPED OUT TWO FIGURES."]
Seized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural, he rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.
After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition.
The twins lay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with nutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the servants, but it was of no avail.
It was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear.
Mr. Otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had been engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful clam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse euchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase.
It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best congratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.
The Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though he lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but "Double Sixes."
The story was well known at the time, though, of course, out of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt was made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's _Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends_.
The ghost, then, was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin having been married _en secondes noces_ to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended.
Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of "The Vampire Monk, or the Bloodless Benedictine," a performance so horrible that when old Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in the year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after disinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and leaving all her money to her London apothecary.
At the last moment, however, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the little Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.
V   A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out riding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen.
As she was running past the Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied she saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who sometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit.
To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself!
He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue.
His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression.
Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity, and determined to try and comfort him.
So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.
"I am so sorry for you," she said, "but my brothers are going back to Eton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you."
"It is absurd asking me to behave myself," he answered, looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him, "quite absurd.
I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and walk about at night, if that is what you mean.
It is my only reason for existing."
"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very wicked.
Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had killed your wife."
"Well, I quite admit it," said the Ghost, petulantly, "but it was a purely family matter, and concerned no one else."
"It is very wrong to kill any one," said Virginia, who at times had a sweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.
"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!
My wife was very plain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about cookery.
Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent pricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table?
However, it is no matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her."
"Starve you to death?
Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry?
I have a sandwich in my case.
Would you like it?"
"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude, vulgar, dishonest family."
cried Virginia, stamping her foot, "it is you who are rude, and horrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the library.
First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the chrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing to look at, and not at all easy to paint.
I never told on you, though I was very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who ever heard of emerald-green blood?"
"Well, really," said the Ghost, rather meekly, "what was I to do?
It is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother began it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I should not have your paints.
As for colour, that is always a matter of taste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this kind."
"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind.
My father will be only too happy to give you a free passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind, there will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are all Democrats.
Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success.
I know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost."
"I don't think I should like America."
"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities," said Virginia, satirically.
answered the Ghost; "you have your navy and your manners."
"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's holiday."
"Please don't go, Miss Virginia," he cried; "I am so lonely and so unhappy, and I really don't know what to do.
I want to go to sleep and I cannot."
"That's quite absurd!
You have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle.
It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at church, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping.
Why, even babies know how to do that, and they are not very clever."
"I have not slept for three hundred years," he said sadly, and Virginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; "for three hundred years I have not slept, and I am so tired."
Virginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves.
She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his old withered face.
"Poor, poor Ghost," she murmured; "have you no place where you can sleep?"
[Illustration: "'POOR, POOR GHOST,' SHE MURMURED; 'HAVE YOU NO PLACE WHERE YOU CAN SLEEP?'"]
"Far away beyond the pine-woods," he answered, in a low, dreamy voice, "there is a little garden.
There the grass grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale sings all night long.
All night long he sings, and the cold crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers."
Virginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.
"You mean the Garden of Death," she whispered.
Death must be so beautiful.
To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence.
To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.
To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace.
You can open for me the portals of death's house, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death is."
Virginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments there was silence.
She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.
Then the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind.
"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?"
"Oh, often," cried the little girl, looking up; "I know it quite well.
It is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read.
There are only six lines:      "'When a golden girl can win     Prayer from out the lips of sin,     When the barren almond bears,     And a little child gives away its tears,     Then shall all the house be still     And peace come to Canterville.'
"But I don't know what they mean."
"They mean," he said, sadly, "that you must weep with me for my sins, because I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no faith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the angel of death will have mercy on me.
You will see fearful shapes in darkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not harm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail."
Virginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head.
Suddenly she stood up, very pale, and with a strange light in her eyes.
"I am not afraid," she said firmly, "and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you."
He rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.
His fingers were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the dusky room.
On the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen.
They blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back.
little Virginia," they cried, "go back!"
but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and she shut her eyes against them.
Horrible animals with lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and murmured, "Beware!
we may never see you again," but the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.
When they reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could not understand.
She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her.
A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress.
"Quick, quick," cried the Ghost, "or it will be too late," and in a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.
[Illustration: "THE GHOST GLIDED ON MORE SWIFTLY"]     VI   About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not come down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her.
After a little time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia anywhere.
As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all alarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not appear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for her, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house.
At half-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere.
They were all now in the greatest state of excitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly remembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies permission to camp in the park.
He accordingly at once set off for Blackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son and two of the farm-servants.
The little Duke of Cheshire, who was perfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle.
On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had gone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.
Having sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran home, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gipsies.
He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom.
He had hardly, however, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed, and no hat.
"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis," gasped out the boy, "but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.
Please don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been all this trouble.
You won't send me back, will you?
I won't go!"
[Illustration: "HE HEARD SOMEBODY GALLOPING AFTER HIM"]  The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace, and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, "Well, Cecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you a hat at Ascot."
"Oh, bother my hat!
cried the little Duke, laughing, and they galloped on to the railway station.
There Mr. Otis inquired of the station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia had been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her.
The station-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a large common next to it.
Here they roused up the rural policeman, but could get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase about eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken.
They found Washington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue was very dark.
Not the slightest trace of Virginia had been discovered.
The gipsies had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late.
Indeed, they had been quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they
