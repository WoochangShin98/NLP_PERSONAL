He did not wish to sleep.
He lay and thought: thought ever of the one thing that constituted the sole aim, meaning, pleasure, and pride of his life--of how much money he had made and might still make, of how much other people he knew had made and possessed, and of how those others had made and were making it, and how he, like them, might still make much more.
The purchase of the Goryachkin grove was a matter of immense importance to him.
By that one deal he hoped to make perhaps ten thousand rubles.
He began mentally to reckon the value of the wood he had inspected in autumn, and on five acres of which he had counted all the trees.
‘The oaks will go for sledge-runners.
The undergrowth will take care of itself, and there’ll still be some thirty sazheens of fire-wood left on each desyatin,’ said he to himself.
‘That means there will be at least two hundred and twenty-five rubles’ worth left on each desyatin.
Fifty-six desyatiins means fifty-six hundreds, and fifty-six hundreds, and fifty-six tens, and another fifty-six tens, and then fifty-six fives....’ He saw that it came out to more than twelve thousand rubles, but could not reckon it up exactly without a counting-frame.
‘But I won’t give ten thousand, anyhow.
I’ll give about eight thousand with a deduction on account of the glades.
I’ll grease the surveyor’s palm--give him a hundred rubles, or a hundred and fifty, and he’ll reckon that there are some five desyatins of glade to be deducted.
And he’ll let it go for eight thousand.
That’ll move him, no fear!’ he thought, and he pressed his pocket-book with his forearm.
‘God only knows how we missed the turning.
The forest ought to be there, and a watchman’s hut, and dogs barking.
But the damned things don’t bark when they’re wanted.’ He turned his collar down from his ear and listened, but as before only the whistling of the wind could be heard, the flapping and fluttering of the kerchief tied to the shafts, and the pelting of the snow against the woodwork of the sledge.
He again covered up his ear.
‘If I had known I would have stayed the night.
Well, no matter, we’ll get there to-morrow.
It’s only one day lost.
And the others won’t travel in such weather.’ Then he remembered that on the 9th he had to receive payment from the butcher for his oxen.
‘He meant to come himself, but he won’t find me, and my wife won’t know how to receive the money.
She doesn’t know the right way of doing things,’ he thought, recalling how at their party the day before she had not known how to treat the police-officer who was their guest.
‘Of course she’s only a woman!
Where could she have seen anything?
In my father’s time what was our house like?
Just a rich peasant’s house: just an oatmill and an inn--that was the whole property.
But what have I done in these fifteen years?
A shop, two taverns, a flour-mill, a grain-store, two farms leased out, and a house with an iron-roofed barn,’ he thought proudly.
‘Not as it was in Father’s time!
Who is talked of in the whole district now?
Because I stick to business.
I take trouble, not like others who lie abed or waste their time on foolishness while I don’t sleep of nights.
Blizzard or no blizzard I start out.
They think money-making is a joke.
No, take pains and rack your brains!
You get overtaken out of doors at night, like this, or keep awake night after night till the thoughts whirling in your head make the pillow turn,’ he meditated with pride.
‘They think people get on through luck.
After all, the Mironovs are now millionaires.
Take pains and God gives.
If only He grants me health!’  The thought that he might himself be a millionaire like Mironov, who began with nothing, so excited Vasili Andreevich that he felt the need of talking to somebody.
But there was no one to talk to....
If only he could have reached Goryachkin he would have talked to the landlord and shown him a thing or two.
‘Just see how it blows!
It will snow us up so deep that we shan’t be able to get out in the morning!’ he thought, listening to a gust of wind that blew against the front of the sledge, bending it and lashing the snow against it.
He raised himself and looked round.
All he could see through the whirling darkness was Mukhorty’s dark head, his back covered by the fluttering drugget, and his thick knotted tail; while all round, in front and behind, was the same fluctuating whity darkness, sometimes seeming to get a little lighter and sometimes growing denser still.
‘A pity I listened to Nikita,’ he thought.
‘We ought to have driven on.
We should have come out somewhere, if only back to Grishkino and stayed the night at Taras’s.
As it is we must sit here all night.
But what was I thinking about?
Yes, that God gives to those who take trouble, but not to loafers, lie-abeds, or fools.
I must have a smoke!’  He sat down again, got out his cigarette-case, and stretched himself flat on his stomach, screening the matches with the skirt of his coat.
But the wind found its way in and put out match after match.
At last he got one to burn and lit a cigarette.
He was very glad that he had managed to do what he wanted, and though the wind smoked more of the cigarette than he did, he still got two or three puffs and felt more cheerful.
He again leant back, wrapped himself up, started reflecting and remembering, and suddenly and quite unexpectedly lost consciousness and fell asleep.
Suddenly something seemed to give him a push and awoke him.
Whether it was Mukhorty who had pulled some straw from under him, or whether something within him had startled him, at all events it woke him, and his heart began to beat faster and faster so that the sledge seemed to tremble under him.
Everything around him was just as before.
‘It looks lighter,’ he thought.
‘I expect it won’t be long before dawn.’ But he at once remembered that it was lighter because the moon had risen.
He sat up and looked first at the horse.
Mukhorty still stood with his back to the wind, shivering all over.
One side of the drugget, which was completely covered with snow, had been blown back, the breeching had slipped down and the snow-covered head with its waving forelock and mane were now more visible.
Vasili Andreevich leant over the back of the sledge and looked behind.
Nikita still sat in the same position in which he had settled himself.
The sacking with which he was covered, and his legs, were thickly covered with snow.
‘If only that peasant doesn’t freeze to death!
His clothes are so wretched.
I may be held responsible for him.
What shiftless people they are--such a want of education,’ thought Vasili Andreevich, and he felt like taking the drugget off the horse and putting it over Nikita, but it would be very cold to get out and move about and, moreover, the horse might freeze to death.
‘Why did I bring him with me?
It was all her stupidity!’ he thought, recalling his unloved wife, and he rolled over into his old place at the front part of the sledge.
‘My uncle once spent a whole night like this,’ he reflected, ‘and was all right.’ But another case came at once to his mind.
‘But when they dug Sebastian out he was dead--stiff like a frozen carcass.
If I’d only stopped the night in Grishkino all this would not have happened!’  And wrapping his coat carefully round him so that none of the warmth of the fur should be wasted but should warm him all over, neck, knees, and feet, he shut his eyes and tried to sleep again.
But try as he would he could not get drowsy, on the contrary he felt wide awake and animated.
Again he began counting his gains and the debts due to him, again he began bragging to himself and feeling pleased with himself and his position, but all this was continually disturbed by a stealthily approaching fear and by the unpleasant regret that he had not remained in Grishkino.
‘How different it would be to be lying warm on a bench!’  He turned over several times in his attempts to get into a more comfortable position more sheltered from the wind, he wrapped up his legs closer, shut his eyes, and lay still.
But either his legs in their strong felt boots began to ache from being bent in one position, or the wind blew in somewhere, and after lying still for a short time he again began to recall the disturbing fact that he might now have been lying quietly in the warm hut at Grishkino.
He again sat up, turned about, muffled himself up, and settled down once more.
Once he fancied that he heard a distant cock-crow.
He felt glad, turned down his coat-collar and listened with strained attention, but in spite of all his efforts nothing could be heard but the wind whistling between the shafts, the flapping of the kerchief, and the snow pelting against the frame of the sledge.
Nikita sat just as he had done all the time, not moving and not even answering Vasili Andreevich who had addressed him a couple of times.
‘He doesn’t care a bit--he’s probably asleep!’ thought Vasili Andreevich with vexation, looking behind the sledge at Nikita who was covered with a thick layer of snow.
Vasili Andreevich got up and lay down again some twenty times.
It seemed to him that the night would never end.
‘It must be getting near morning,’ he thought, getting up and looking around.
‘Let’s have a look at my watch.
It will be cold to unbutton, but if I only know that it’s getting near morning I shall at any rate feel more cheerful.
We could begin harnessing.’  In the depth of his heart Vasili Andreevich knew that it could not yet be near morning, but he was growing more and more afraid, and wished both to get to know and yet to deceive himself.
He carefully undid the fastening of his sheepskin, pushed in his hand, and felt about for a long time before he got to his waistcoat.
With great difficulty he managed to draw out his silver watch with its enamelled flower design, and tried to make out the time.
He could not see anything without a light.
Again he went down on his knees and elbows as he had done when he lighted a cigarette, got out his matches, and proceeded to strike one.
This time he went to work more carefully, and feeling with his fingers for a match with the largest head and the greatest amount of phosphorus, lit it at the first try.
Bringing the face of the watch under the light he could hardly believe his eyes....
It was only ten minutes past twelve.
Almost the whole night was still before him.
‘Oh, how long the night is!’ he thought, feeling a cold shudder run down his back, and having fastened his fur coats again and wrapped himself up, he snuggled into a corner of the sledge intending to wait patiently.
Suddenly, above the monotonous roar of the wind, he clearly distinguished another new and living sound.
It steadily strengthened, and having become quite clear diminished just as gradually.
Beyond all doubt it was a wolf, and he was so near that the movement of his jaws as he changed his cry was brought down the wind.
Vasili Andreevich turned back the collar of his coat and listened attentively.
Mukhorty too strained to listen, moving his ears, and when the wolf had ceased its howling he shifted from foot to foot and gave a warning snort.
After this Vasili Andreevich could not fall asleep again or even calm himself.
The more he tried to think of his accounts, his business, his reputation, his worth and his wealth, the more and more was he mastered by fear, and regrets that he had not stayed the night at Grishkino dominated and mingled in all his thoughts.
‘Devil take the forest!
Things were all right without it, thank God.
Ah, if we had only put up for the night!’ he said to himself.
‘They say it’s drunkards that freeze,’ he thought, ‘and I have had some drink.’ And observing his sensations he noticed that he was beginning to shiver, without knowing whether it was from cold or from fear.
He tried to wrap himself up and lie down as before, but could no longer do so.
He could not stay in one position.
He wanted to get up, to do something to master the gathering fear that was rising in him and against which he felt himself powerless.
He again got out his cigarettes and matches, but only three matches were left and they were bad ones.
The phosphorus rubbed off them all without lighting.
‘The devil take you!
Curse you!’ he muttered, not knowing whom or what he was cursing, and he flung away the crushed cigarette.
He was about to throw away the matchbox too, but checked the movement of his hand and put the box in his pocket instead.
He was seized with such unrest that he could no longer remain in one spot.
He climbed out of the sledge and standing with his back to the wind began to shift his belt again, fastening it lower down in the waist and tightening it.
‘What’s the use of lying and waiting for death?
Better mount the horse and get away!’ The thought suddenly occurred to him.
‘The horse will move when he has someone on his back.
As for him,’ he thought of Nikita--‘it’s all the same to him whether he lives or dies.
What is his life worth?
He won’t grudge his life, but I have something to live for, thank God.’  He untied the horse, threw the reins over his neck and tried to mount, but his coats and boots were so heavy that he failed.
Then he clambered up in the sledge and tried to mount from there, but the sledge tilted under his weight, and he failed again.
At last he drew Mukhorty nearer to the sledge, cautiously balanced on one side of it, and managed to lie on his stomach across the horse’s back.
After lying like that for a while he shifted forward once and again, threw a leg over, and finally seated himself, supporting his feet on the loose breeching-straps.
The shaking of the sledge awoke Nikita.
He raised himself, and it seemed to Vasili Andreevich that he said something.
‘Listen to such fools as you!
Am I to die like this for nothing?’ exclaimed Vasili Andreevich.
And tucking the loose skirts of his fur coat in under his knees, he turned the horse and rode away from the sledge in the direction in which he thought the forest and the forester’s hut must be.
VII  From the time he had covered himself with the sackcloth and seated himself behind the sledge, Nikita had not stirred.
Like all those who live in touch with nature and have known want, he was patient and could wait for hours, even days, without growing restless or irritable.
He heard his master call him, but did not answer because he did not want to move or talk.
Though he still felt some warmth from the tea he had drunk and from his energetic struggle when clambering about in the snowdrift, he knew that this warmth would not last long and that he had no strength left to warm himself again by moving about, for he felt as tired as a horse when it stops and refuses to go further in spite of the whip, and its master sees that it must be fed before it can work again.
The foot in the boot with a hole in it had already grown numb, and he could no longer feel his big toe.
Besides that, his whole body began to feel colder and colder.
The thought that he might, and very probably would, die that night occurred to him, but did not seem particularly unpleasant or dreadful.
It did not seem particularly unpleasant, because his whole life had been not a continual holiday, but on the contrary an unceasing round of toil of which he was beginning to feel weary.
And it did not seem particularly dreadful, because besides the masters he had served here, like Vasili Andreevich, he always felt himself dependent on the Chief Master, who had sent him into this life, and he knew that when dying he would still be in that Master’s power and would not be ill-used by Him.
‘It seems a pity to give up what one is used to and accustomed to.
But there’s nothing to be done, I shall get used to the new things.’  ‘Sins?’ he thought, and remembered his drunkenness, the money that had gone on drink, how he had offended his wife, his cursing, his neglect of church and of the fasts, and all the things the priest blamed him for at confession.
‘Of course they are sins.
But then, did I take them on of myself?
That’s evidently how God made me.
Well, and the sins?
Where am I to escape to?’  So at first he thought of what might happen to him that night, and then did not return to such thoughts but gave himself up to whatever recollections came into his head of themselves.
Now he thought of Martha’s arrival, of the drunkenness among the workers and his own renunciation of drink, then of their present journey and of Taras’s house and the talk about the breaking-up of the family, then of his own lad, and of Mukhorty now sheltered under the drugget, and then of his master who made the sledge creak as he tossed about in it.
‘I expect you’re sorry yourself that you started out, dear man,’ he thought.
‘It would seem hard to leave a life such as his!
It’s not like the likes of us.’  Then all these recollections began to grow confused and got mixed in his head, and he fell asleep.
But when Vasili Andreevich, getting on the horse, jerked the sledge, against the back of which Nikita was leaning, and it shifted away and hit him in the back with one of its runners, he awoke and had to change his position whether he liked it or not.
Straightening his legs with difficulty and shaking the snow off them he got up, and an agonizing cold immediately penetrated his whole body.
On making out what was happening he called to Vasili Andreevich to leave him the drugget which the horse no longer needed, so that he might wrap himself in it.
But Vasili Andreevich did not stop, but disappeared amid the powdery snow.
Left alone Nikita considered for a moment what he should do.
He felt that he had not the strength to go off in search of a house.
It was no longer possible to sit down in his old place--it was by now all filled with snow.
He felt that he could not get warmer in the sledge either, for there was nothing to cover himself with, and his coat and sheepskin no longer warmed him at all.
He felt as cold as though he had nothing on but a shirt.
‘Lord, heavenly Father!’ he muttered, and was comforted by the consciousness that he was not alone but that there was One who heard him and would not abandon him.
He gave a deep sigh, and keeping the sackcloth over his head he got inside the sledge and lay down in the place where his master had been.
But he could not get warm in the sledge either.
At first he shivered all over, then the shivering ceased and little by little he began to lose consciousness.
He did not know whether he was dying or falling asleep, but felt equally prepared for the one as for the other.
VIII  Meanwhile Vasili Andreevich, with his feet and the ends of the reins, urged the horse on in the direction in which for some reason he expected the forest and forester’s hut to be.
The snow covered his eyes and the wind seemed intent on stopping him, but bending forward and constantly lapping his coat over and pushing it between himself and the cold harness pad which prevented him from sitting properly, he kept urging the horse on.
Mukhorty ambled on obediently though with difficulty, in the direction in which he was driven.
Vasili Andreevich rode for about five minutes straight ahead, as he thought, seeing nothing but the horse’s head and the white waste, and hearing only the whistle of the wind about the horse’s ears and his coat collar.
Suddenly a dark patch showed up in front of him.
His heart beat with joy, and he rode towards the object, already seeing in imagination the walls of village houses.
But the dark patch was not stationary, it kept moving; and it was not a village but some tall stalks of wormwood sticking up through the snow on the boundary between two fields, and desperately tossing about under the pressure of the wind which beat it all to one side and whistled through it.
The sight of that wormwood tormented by the pitiless wind made Vasili Andreevich shudder, he knew not why, and he hurriedly began urging the horse on, not noticing that when riding up to the wormwood he had quite changed his direction and was now heading the opposite way, though still imagining that he was riding towards where the hut should be.
But the horse kept making towards the right, and Vasili Andreevich kept guiding it to the left.
Again something dark appeared in front of him.
Again he rejoiced, convinced that now it was certainly a village.
But once more it was the same boundary line overgrown with wormwood, once more the same wormwood desperately tossed by the wind and carrying unreasoning terror to his heart.
But its being the same wormwood was not all, for beside it there was a horse’s track partly snowed over.
Vasili Andreevich stopped, stooped down and looked carefully.
It was a horse-track only partially covered with snow, and could be none but his own horse’s hoofprints.
He had evidently gone round in a small circle.
‘I shall perish like that!’ he thought, and not to give way to his terror he urged on the horse still more, peering into the snowy darkness in which he saw only flitting and fitful points of light.
Once he thought he heard the barking of dogs or the howling of wolves, but the sounds were so faint and indistinct that he did not know whether he heard them or merely imagined them, and he stopped and began to listen intently.
Suddenly some terrible, deafening cry resounded near his ears, and everything shivered and shook under him.
He seized Mukhorty’s neck, but that too was shaking all over and the terrible cry grew still more frightful.
For some seconds Vasili Andreevich could not collect himself or understand what was happening.
It was only that Mukhorty, whether to encourage himself or to call for help, had neighed loudly and resonantly.
‘Ugh, you wretch!
How you frightened me, damn you!’ thought Vasili Andreevich.
But even when he understood the cause of his terror he could not shake it off.
‘I must calm myself and think things over,’ he said to himself, but yet he could not stop, and continued to urge the horse on, without noticing that he was now going with the wind instead of against it.
His body, especially between his legs where it touched the pad of the harness and was not covered by his overcoats, was getting painfully cold, especially when the horse walked slowly.
His legs and arms trembled and his breathing came fast.
He saw himself perishing amid this dreadful snowy waste, and could see no means of escape.
Suddenly the horse under him tumbled into something and, sinking into a snow-drift, began to plunge and fell on his side.
Vasili Andreevich jumped off, and in so doing dragged to one side the breechband on which his foot was resting, and twisted round the pad to which he held as he dismounted.
As soon as he had jumped off, the horse struggled to his feet, plunged forward, gave one leap and another, neighed again, and dragging the drugget and the breechband after him, disappeared, leaving Vasili Andreevich alone on the snow-drift.
The latter pressed on after the horse, but the snow lay so deep and his coats were so heavy that, sinking above his knees at each step, he stopped breathless after taking not more than twenty steps.
‘The copse, the oxen, the lease-hold, the shop, the tavern, the house with the iron-roofed barn, and my heir,’ thought he.
‘How can I leave all that?
It cannot be!’ These thoughts flashed through his mind.
Then he thought of the wormwood tossed by the wind, which he had twice ridden past, and he was seized with such terror that he did not believe in the reality of what was happening to him.
‘Can this be a dream?’ he thought, and tried to wake up but could not.
It was real snow that lashed his face and covered him and chilled his right hand from which he had lost the glove, and this was a real desert in which he was now left alone like that wormwood, awaiting an inevitable, speedy, and meaningless death.
Holy Father Nicholas, teacher of temperance!’ he thought, recalling the service of the day before and the holy icon with its black face and gilt frame, and the tapers which he sold to be set before that icon and which were almost immediately brought back to him scarcely burnt at all, and which he put away in the store-chest.
He began to pray to that same Nicholas the Wonder-Worker to save him, promising him a thanksgiving service and some candles.
But he clearly and indubitably realized that the icon, its frame, the candles, the priest, and the thanksgiving service, though very important and necessary in church, could do nothing for him here, and that there was and could be no connexion between those candles and services and his present disastrous plight.
‘I must not despair,’ he thought.
‘I must follow the horse’s track before it is snowed under.
He will lead me out, or I may even catch him.
Only I must not hurry, or I shall stick fast and be more lost than ever.’  But in spite of his resolution to go quietly, he rushed forward and even ran, continually falling, getting up and falling again.
The horse’s track was already hardly visible in places where the snow did not lie deep.
‘I am lost!’ thought Vasili Andreevich.
‘I shall lose the track and not catch the horse.’ But at that moment he saw something black.
It was Mukhorty, and not only Mukhorty, but the sledge with the shafts and the kerchief.
Mukhorty, with the sacking and the breechband twisted round to one side, was standing not in his former place but nearer to the shafts, shaking his head which the reins he was stepping on drew downwards.
It turned out that Vasili Andreevich had sunk in the same ravine Nikita had previously fallen into, and that Mukhorty had been bringing him back to the sledge and he had got off his back no more than fifty paces from where the sledge was.
IX  Having stumbled back to the sledge Vasili Andreevich caught hold of it and for a long time stood motionless, trying to calm himself and recover his breath.
Nikita was not in his former place, but something, already covered with snow, was lying in the sledge and Vasili Andreevich concluded that this was Nikita.
His terror had now quite left him, and if he felt any fear it was lest the dreadful terror should return that he had experienced when on the horse and especially when he was left alone in the snow-drift.
At any cost he had to avoid that terror, and to keep it away he must do something--occupy himself with something.
And the first thing he did was to turn his back to the wind and open his fur coat.
Then, as soon as he recovered his breath a little, he shook the snow out of his boots and out of his left-hand glove (the right-hand glove was hopelessly lost and by this time probably lying somewhere under a dozen inches of snow); then as was his custom when going out of his shop to buy grain from the peasants, he pulled his girdle low down and tightened it and prepared for action.
The first thing that occurred to him was to free Mukhorty’s leg from the rein.
Having done that, and tethered him to the iron cramp at the front of the sledge where he had been before, he was going round the horse’s quarters to put the breechband and pad straight and cover him with the cloth, but at that moment he noticed that something was moving in the sledge and Nikita’s head rose up out of the snow that covered it.
Nikita, who was half frozen, rose with great difficulty and sat up, moving his hand before his nose in a strange manner just as if he were driving away flies.
He waved his hand and said something, and seemed to Vasili Andreevich to be calling him.
Vasili Andreevich left the cloth unadjusted and went up to the sledge.
‘What is it?’ he asked.
‘What are you saying?’  ‘I’m dy... ing, that’s what,’ said Nikita brokenly and with difficulty.
‘Give what is owing to me to my lad, or to my wife, no matter.’  ‘Why, are you really frozen?’ asked Vasili Andreevich.
‘I feel it’s my death.
Forgive me for Christ’s sake...’ said Nikita in a tearful voice, continuing to wave his hand before his face as if driving away flies.
Vasili Andreevich stood silent and motionless for half a minute.
Then suddenly, with the same resolution with which he used to strike hands when making a good purchase, he took a step back and turning up his sleeves began raking the snow off Nikita and out of the sledge.
Having done this he hurriedly undid his girdle, opened out his fur coat, and having pushed Nikita down, lay down on top of him, covering him not only with his fur coat but with the whole of his body, which glowed with warmth.
After pushing the skirts of his coat between Nikita and the sides of the sledge, and holding down its hem with his knees, Vasili Andreevich lay like that face down, with his head pressed against the front of the sledge.
Here he no longer heard the horse’s movements or the whistling of the wind, but only Nikita’s breathing.
At first and for a long time Nikita lay motionless, then he sighed deeply and moved.
music-shop; she loved playing cards and played remarkably well.
But it was Eugene Mihailovich’s wife who was the winner all the time.
The best cards were continually in her hands.
At her side she had a plate with grapes and a pear and was in the best of spirits.
Why is he so late?” asked the hostess, who played at another table.
“Probably busy settling accounts,” said Eugene Mihailovich’s wife.
“He has to pay off the tradesmen, to get in firewood.” The quarrel she had with her husband revived in her memory; she frowned, and her hands, from which she had not taken off the mittens, shook with fury against him.
“Oh, there he is.--We have just been speaking of you,” said the hostess to Eugene Mihailovich, who came in at that very moment.
“Why are you so late?”  “I was busy,” answered Eugene Mihailovich, in a gay voice, rubbing his hands.
And to his wife’s surprise he came to her side and said,--“You know, I managed to get rid of the coupon.”  “No!
You don’t say so!”  “Yes, I used it to pay for a cartload of firewood I bought from a peasant.”  And Eugene Mihailovich related with great indignation to the company present--his wife adding more details to his narrative--how his wife had been cheated by two unscrupulous schoolboys.
“Well, and now let us sit down to work,” he said, taking his place at one of the whist-tables when his turn came, and beginning to shuffle the cards.
VI  EUGENE MIHAILOVICH had actually used the coupon to buy firewood from the peasant Ivan Mironov, who had thought of setting up in business on the seventeen roubles he possessed.
He hoped in this way to earn another eight roubles, and with the twenty-five roubles thus amassed he intended to buy a good strong horse, which he would want in the spring for work in the fields and for driving on the roads, as his old horse was almost played out.
Ivan Mironov’s commercial method consisted in buying from the stores a cord of wood and dividing it into five cartloads, and then driving about the town, selling each of these at the price the stores charged for a quarter of a cord.
That unfortunate day Ivan Mironov drove out very early with half a cartload, which he soon sold.
He loaded up again with another cartload which he hoped to sell, but he looked in vain for a customer; no one would buy it.
It was his bad luck all that day to come across experienced towns-people, who knew all the tricks of the peasants in selling firewood, and would not believe that he had actually brought the wood from the country as he assured them.
He got hungry, and felt cold in his ragged woollen coat.
It was nearly below zero when evening came on; his horse which he had treated without mercy, hoping soon to sell it to the knacker’s yard, refused to move a step.
So Ivan Mironov was quite ready to sell his firewood at a loss when he met Eugene Mihailovich, who was on his way home from the tobacconist.
“Buy my cartload of firewood, sir.
I will give it to you cheap.
My poor horse is tired, and can’t go any farther.”  “Where do you come from?”  “From the country, sir.
This firewood is from our place.
Good dry wood, I can assure you.”  “Good wood indeed!
Well, what is your price?”  Ivan Mironov began by asking a high price, but reduced it once, and finished by selling the cartload for just what it had cost him.
“I’m giving it to you cheap, just to please you, sir.--Besides, I am glad it is not a long way to your house,” he added.
Eugene Mihailovich did not bargain very much.
He did not mind paying a little more, because he was delighted to think he could make use of the coupon and get rid of it.
With great difficulty Ivan Mironov managed at last, by pulling the shafts himself, to drag his cart into the courtyard, where he was obliged to unload the firewood unaided and pile it up in the shed.
Ivan Mironov hesitated at first to accept the coupon, but Eugene Mihailovich insisted, and as he looked a very important person the peasant at last agreed.
He went by the backstairs to the servants’ room, crossed himself before the ikon, wiped his beard which was covered with icicles, turned up the skirts of his coat, took out of his pocket a leather purse, and out of the purse eight roubles and fifty kopeks, and handed the change to Eugene Mihailovich.
Carefully folding the coupon, he put it in the purse.
Then, according to custom, he thanked the gentleman for his kindness, and, using the whip-handle instead of the lash, he belaboured the half-frozen horse that he had doomed to an early death, and betook himself to a public-house.
Arriving there, Ivan Mironov called for vodka and tea for which he paid eight kopeks.
Comfortable and warm after the tea, he chatted in the very best of spirits with a yard-porter who was sitting at his table.
Soon he grew communicative and told his companion all about the conditions of his life.
He told him he came from the village Vassilievsky, twelve miles from town, and also that he had his allotment of land given to him by his family, as he wanted to live apart from his father and his brothers; that he had a wife and two children; the elder boy went to school, and did not yet help him in his work.
He also said he lived in lodgings and intended going to the horse-fair the next day to look for a good horse, and, may be, to buy one.
He went on to state that he had now nearly twenty-five roubles--only one rouble short--and that half of it was a coupon.
He took the coupon out of his purse to show to his new friend.
The yard-porter was an illiterate man, but he said he had had such coupons given him by lodgers to change; that they were good; but that one might also chance on forged ones; so he advised the peasant, for the sake of security, to change it at once at the counter.
Ivan Mironov gave the coupon to the waiter and asked for change.
The waiter, however, did not bring the change, but came back with the manager, a bald-headed man with a shining face, who was holding the coupon in his fat hand.
“Your money is no good,” he said, showing the coupon, but apparently determined not to give it back.
“The coupon must be all right.
I got it from a gentleman.”  “It is bad, I tell you.
The coupon is forged.”  “Forged?
Give it back to me.”  “I will not.
You fellows have got to be punished for such tricks.
Of course, you did it yourself--you and some of your rascally friends.”  “Give me the money.
What right have you--”  “Sidor!
Call a policeman,” said the barman to the waiter.
Ivan Mironov was rather drunk, and in that condition was hard to manage.
He seized the manager by the collar and began to shout.
“Give me back my money, I say.
I will go to the gentleman who gave it to me.
I know where he lives.”  The manager had to struggle with all his force to get loose from Ivan Mironov, and his shirt was torn,--“Oh, that’s the way you behave!
Get hold of him.”  The waiter took hold of Ivan Mironov; at that moment the policeman arrived.
Looking very important, he inquired what had happened, and unhesitatingly gave his orders:  “Take him to the police-station.”  As to the coupon, the policeman put it in his pocket; Ivan Mironov, together with his horse, was brought to the nearest station.
VII  IVAN MIRONOV had to spend the night in the police-station, in the company of drunkards and thieves.
It was noon of the next day when he was summoned to the police officer; put through a close examination, and sent in the care of a policeman to Eugene Mihailovich’s shop.
Ivan Mironov remembered the street and the house.
The policeman asked for the shopkeeper, showed him the coupon and confronted him with Ivan Mironov, who declared that he had received the coupon in that very place.
Eugene Mihailovich at once assumed a very severe and astonished air.
“You are mad, my good fellow,” he said.
“I have never seen this man before in my life,” he added, addressing the policeman.
“It is a sin, sir,” said Ivan Mironov.
“Think of the hour when you will die.”  “Why, you must be dreaming!
You have sold your firewood to some one else,” said Eugene Mihailovich.
“But wait a minute.
I will go and ask my wife whether she bought any firewood yesterday.” Eugene Mihailovich left them and immediately called the yard-porter Vassily, a strong, handsome, quick, cheerful, well-dressed man.
He told Vassily that if any one should inquire where the last supply of firewood was bought, he was to say they’d got it from the stores, and not from a peasant in the street.
“A peasant has come,” he said to Vassily, “who has declared to the police that I gave him a forged coupon.
He is a fool and talks nonsense, but you, are a clever man.
Mind you say that we always get the firewood from the stores.
And, by the way, I’ve been thinking some time of giving you money to buy a new jacket,” added Eugene Mihailovich, and gave the man five roubles.
Vassily looking with pleasure first at the five rouble note, then at Eugene Mihailovich’s face, shook his head and smiled.
“I know, those peasant folks have no brains.
Don’t you be uneasy.
I know what I have to say.”  Ivan Mironov, with tears in his eyes, implored Eugene Mihailovich over and over again to acknowledge the coupon he had given him, and the yard-porter to believe what he said, but it proved quite useless; they both insisted that they had never bought firewood from a peasant in the street.
The policeman brought Ivan Mironov back to the police-station, and he was charged with forging the coupon.
Only after taking the advice of a drunken office clerk in the same cell with him, and bribing the police officer with five roubles, did Ivan Mironov get out of jail, without the coupon, and with only seven roubles left out of the twenty-five he had the day before.
Of these seven roubles he spent three in the public-house and came home to his wife dead drunk, with a bruised and swollen face.
His wife was expecting a child, and felt very ill. She began to scold her husband; he pushed her away, and she struck him.
Without answering a word he lay down on the plank and began to weep bitterly.
Not till the next day did he tell his wife what had actually happened.
She believed him at once, and thoroughly cursed the dastardly rich man who had cheated Ivan.
He was sobered now, and remembering the advice a workman had given him, with whom he had many a drink the day before, decided to go to a lawyer and tell him of the wrong the owner of the photograph shop had done him.
VIII  THE lawyer consented to take proceedings on behalf of Ivan Mironov, not so much for the sake of the fee, as because he believed the peasant, and was revolted by the wrong done to him.
Both parties appeared in the court when the case was tried, and the yard-porter Vassily was summoned as witness.
They repeated in the court all they had said before to the police officials.
Ivan Mironov again called to his aid the name of the Divinity, and reminded the shopkeeper of the hour of death.
Eugene Mihailovich, although quite aware of his wickedness, and the risks he was running, despite the rebukes of his conscience, could not now change his testimony, and went on calmly to deny all the allegations made against him.
The yard-porter Vassily had received another ten roubles from his master, and, quite unperturbed, asserted with a smile that he did not know anything about Ivan Mironov.
And when he was called upon to take the oath, he overcame his inner qualms, and repeated with assumed ease the terms of the oath, read to him by the old priest appointed to the court.
By the holy Cross and the Gospel, he swore that he spoke the whole truth.
The case was decided against Ivan Mironov, who was sentenced to pay five roubles for expenses.
This sum Eugene Mihailovich generously paid for him.
Before dismissing Ivan Mironov, the judge severely admonished him, saying he ought to take care in the future not to accuse respectable people, and that he also ought to be thankful that he was not forced to pay the costs, and that he had escaped a prosecution for slander, for which he would have been condemned to three months’ imprisonment.
“I offer my humble thanks,” said Ivan Mironov; and, shaking his head, left the court with a heavy sigh.
The whole thing seemed to have ended well for Eugene Mihailovich and the yard-porter Vassily.
Something had happened which was not noticed by any one, but which was much more important than all that had been exposed to view.
Vassily had left his village and settled in town over two years ago.
As time went on he sent less and less money to his father, and he did not ask his wife, who remained at home, to join him.
He was in no need of her; he could in town have as many wives as he wished, and much better ones too than that clumsy, village-bred woman.
Vassily, with each recurring year, became more and more familiar with the ways of the town people, forgetting the conventions of a country life.
There everything was so vulgar, so grey, so poor and untidy.
Here, in town, all seemed on the contrary so refined, nice, clean, and rich; so orderly too.
And he became more and more convinced that people in the country live just like wild beasts, having no idea of what life is, and that only life in town is real.
He read books written by clever writers, and went to the performances in the Peoples’ Palace.
In the country, people would not see such wonders even in dreams.
In the country old men say: “Obey the law, and live with your wife; work; don’t eat too much; don’t care for finery,” while here, in town, all the clever and learned people--those, of course, who know what in reality the law is--only pursue their own pleasures.
And they are the better for it.
Previous to the incident of the forged coupon, Vassily could not actually believe that rich people lived without any moral law.
But after that, still more after having perjured himself, and not being the worse for it in spite of his fears--on the contrary, he had gained ten roubles out of it--Vassily became firmly convinced that no moral laws whatever exist, and that the only thing to do is to pursue one’s own interests and pleasures.
This he now made his rule in life.
He accordingly got as much profit as he could out of purchasing goods for lodgers.
But this did not pay all his expenses.
Then he took to stealing, whenever chance offered--money and all sorts of valuables.
One day he stole a purse full of money from Eugene Mihailovich, but was found out.
Eugene Mihailovich did not hand him over to the police, but dismissed him on the spot.
Vassily had no wish whatever to return home to his village, and remained in Moscow with his sweetheart, looking out for a new job.
He got one as yard-porter at a grocer’s, but with only small wages.
The next day after he had entered that service he was caught stealing bags.
The grocer did not call in the police, but gave him a good thrashing and turned him out.
After that he could not find work.
The money he had left was soon gone; he had to sell all his clothes and went about nearly in rags.
But notwithstanding, he kept up his high spirits, and when the spring came he started to walk home.
IX  PETER NIKOLAEVICH SVENTIZKY, a short man in black spectacles (he had weak eyes, and was threatened with complete blindness), got up, as was his custom, at dawn of day, had a cup of tea, and putting on his short fur coat trimmed with astrachan, went to look after the work on his estate.
Peter Nikolaevich had been an official in the Customs, and had gained eighteen thousand roubles during his service.
About twelve years ago he quitted the service--not quite of his own accord: as a matter of fact he had been compelled to leave--and bought an estate from a young landowner who had dissipated his fortune.
Peter Nikolaevich had married at an earlier period, while still an official in the Customs.
His wife, who belonged to an old noble family, was an orphan, and was left without money.
She was a tall, stoutish, good-looking woman.
Peter Nikolaevich had considerable practical talents and a strong will.
He was the son of a Polish gentleman, and knew nothing about agriculture and land management; but when he acquired an estate of his own, he managed it so well that after fifteen years the waste piece of land, consisting of three hundred acres, became a model estate.
All the buildings, from the dwelling-house to the corn stores and the shed for the fire engine were solidly built, had iron roofs, and were painted at the right time.
In the tool house carts, ploughs, harrows, stood in perfect order, the harness was well cleaned and oiled.
The horses were not very big, but all home-bred, grey, well fed, strong and devoid of blemish.
The threshing machine worked in a roofed barn, the forage was kept in a separate shed, and a paved drain was made from the stables.
The cows were home-bred, not very large, but giving plenty of milk; fowls were also kept in the poultry yard, and the hens were of a special kind, laying a great quantity of eggs.
In the orchard the fruit trees were well whitewashed and propped on poles to enable them to grow straight.
Everything was looked after--solid, clean, and in perfect order.
Peter Nikolaevich rejoiced in the perfect condition of his estate, and was proud to have achieved it--not by oppressing the peasants, but, on the contrary, by the extreme fairness of his dealings with them.
Among the nobles of his province he belonged to the advanced party, and was more inclined to liberal than conservative views, always taking the side of the peasants against those who were still in favour of serfdom.
“Treat them well, and they will be fair to you,” he used to say.
Of course, he did not overlook any carelessness on the part of those who worked on his estate, and he urged them on to work if they were lazy; but then he gave them good lodging, with plenty of good food, paid their wages without any delay, and gave them drinks on days of festival.
Walking cautiously on the melting snow--for the time of the year was February--Peter Nikolaevich passed the stables, and made his way to the cottage where his workmen were lodged.
It was still dark, the darker because of the dense fog; but the windows of the cottage were lighted.
The men had already got up.
His intention was to urge them to begin work.
He had arranged that they should drive out to the forest and bring back the last supply of firewood he needed before spring.
“What is that?” he thought, seeing the door of the stable wide open.
“Hallo, who is there?”  No answer.
Peter Nikolaevich stepped into the stable.
It was dark; the ground was soft under his feet, and the air smelt of dung; on the right side of the door were two loose boxes for a pair of grey horses.
Peter Nikolaevich stretched out his hand in their direction--one box was empty.
He put out his foot--the horse might have been lying down.
But his foot did not touch anything solid.
“Where could they have taken the horse?” he thought.
They certainly had not harnessed it; all the sledges stood still outside.
Peter Nikolaevich went out of the stable.
“Stepan, come here!” he called.
Stepan was the head of the workmen’s gang.
He was just stepping out of the cottage.
“Here I am!” he said, in a cheerful voice.
“Oh, is that you, Peter Nikolaevich?
Our men are coming.”  “Why is the stable door open?
I don’t know anything about it.
I say, Proshka, bring the lantern!”  Proshka came with the lantern.
They all went to the stable, and Stepan knew at once what had happened.
“Thieves have been here, Peter Nikolaevich,” he said.
“The lock is broken.”  “No; you don’t say so!”  “Yes, the brigands!
I don’t see ‘Mashka.’ ‘Hawk’ is here.
But ‘Beauty’ is not.
Nor yet ‘Dapple-grey.’”  Three horses had been stolen!
Peter Nikolaevich did not utter a word at first.
He only frowned and took deep breaths.
“Oh,” he said after a while.
“If only I could lay hands on them!
Who was on guard?”  “Peter.
He evidently fell asleep.”  Peter Nikolaevich called in the police, and making an appeal to all the authorities, sent his men to track the thieves.
But the horses were not to be found.
“Wicked people,” said Peter Nikolaevich.
I was always so kind to them.
Brigands the whole lot of them.
I will no longer be kind.”   X  IN the meanwhile the horses, the grey ones, had all been disposed of; Mashka was sold to the gipsies for eighteen roubles; Dapple-grey was exchanged for another horse, and passed over to another peasant who lived forty miles away from the estate; and Beauty died on the way.
The man who conducted the whole affair was--Ivan Mironov.
He had been employed on the estate, and knew all the whereabouts of Peter Nikolaevich.
He wanted to get back the money he had lost, and stole the horses for that reason.
After his misfortune with the forged coupon, Ivan Mironov took to drink; and all he possessed would have gone on drink if it had not been for his wife, who locked up his clothes, the horses’ collars, and all the rest of what he would otherwise have squandered in public-houses.
In his drunken state Ivan Mironov was continually thinking, not only of the man who had wronged him, but of all the rich people who live on robbing the poor.
One day he had a drink with some peasants from the suburbs of Podolsk, and was walking home together with them.
On the way the peasants, who were completely drunk, told him they had stolen a horse from a peasant’s cottage.
Ivan Mironov got angry, and began to abuse the horse-thieves.
“What a shame!” he said.
“A horse is like a brother to the peasant.
And you robbed him of it?
It is a great sin, I tell you.
If you go in for stealing horses, steal them from the landowners.
They are worse than dogs, and deserve anything.”  The talk went on, and the peasants from Podolsk told him that it required a great deal of cunning to steal a horse on an estate.
“You must know all the ins and outs of the place, and must have somebody on the spot to help you.”  Then it occurred to Ivan Mironov that he knew a landowner--Sventizky; he had worked on his estate, and Sventizky, when paying him off, had deducted one rouble and a half for a broken tool.
He remembered well the grey horses which he used to drive at Sventizky’s.
Ivan Mironov called on Peter Nikolaevich pretending to ask for employment, but really in order to get the information he wanted.
He took precautions to make sure that the watchman was absent, and that the horses were standing in their boxes in the stable.
He brought the thieves to the place, and helped them to carry off the three horses.
They divided their gains, and Ivan Mironov returned to his wife with five roubles in his pocket.
He had nothing to do at home, having no horse to work in the field, and therefore continued to steal horses in company with professional horse-thieves and gipsies.
XI  PETER NIKOLAEVICH SVENTIZKY did his best to discover who had stolen his horses.
He knew somebody on the estate must have helped the thieves, and began to suspect all his staff.
He inquired who had slept out that night, and the gang of the working men told him Proshka had not been in the whole night.
Proshka, or Prokofy Nikolaevich, was a young fellow who had just finished his military service, handsome, and skilful in all he did; Peter Nikolaevich employed him at times as coachman.
The district constable was a friend of Peter Nikolaevich, as were the provincial head of the police, the marshal of the nobility, and also the rural councillor and the examining magistrate.
They all came to his house on his saint’s day, drinking the cherry brandy he offered them with pleasure, and eating the nice preserved mushrooms of all kinds to accompany the liqueurs.
They all sympathised with him in his trouble and tried to help him.
“You always used to take the side of the peasants,” said the district constable, “and there you are!
I was right in saying they are worse than wild beasts.
Flogging is the only way to keep them in order.
Well, you say it is all Proshka’s doings.
Is it not he who was your coachman sometimes?”  “Yes, that is he.”  “Will you kindly call him?”  Proshka was summoned before the constable, who began to examine him.
“Where were you that night?”  Proshka pushed back his hair, and his eyes sparkled.
“At home.”  “How so?
All the men say you were not in.”
