# NLP Personal Projects

## N-gram LM (Authorship Classification)
- Built n-gram language models for multiple authors (Austen, Dickens, Tolstoy, Wilde)
- Implemented an authorship classifier based on perplexity comparison
- Applied smoothing/backoff to handle unseen n-grams
- Experimented with different n values (e.g., bigram, trigram)
- Used BPE tokenization (Hugging Face / tiktoken) for preprocessing

## Pytorch MLP Text Classifier With Jisun Kim
- Implemented an NLP model for text classification / sequence labeling  
- Preprocessed text data and built training pipelines  
- Trained and evaluated models with different configurations  
- Analyzed results and reported performance
