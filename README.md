N-gram LM (Authorship Classification)

Built n-gram language models for multiple authors (Austen, Dickens, Tolstoy, Wilde)

Implemented an authorship classifier based on perplexity comparison

Applied smoothing/backoff to handle unseen n-grams

Experimented with different n values (e.g., bigram, trigram)

Used BPE tokenization (Hugging Face / tiktoken) for preprocessing
